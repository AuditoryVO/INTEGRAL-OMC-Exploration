# INTEGRAL-OMC Musical exploration
This Jupyter Notebook prototype explores the light curves of the INTEGRAL-OMC archive following the score of a user selected MIDI file. It sends the MIDI notes of the score to any user-selected MIDI synthesizer or Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) such as GarageBand, Reason or Reaper. Additionally, it shows a light curve associated to each note through the "best fit" period found in the data, calculated with the Box-Least-Square (BLS) method.
